# Snowflake-pipeline-

This lab is based on the analytics team at Citi Bike, a real, citywide bike sharing system in New York City, USA. The team wants to run analytics on data from their internal transactional systems to better understand their riders and how to best serve them.

We will first load structured .csv data from rider transactions into Snowflake. Later we will work with open-source, semi-structured JSON weather data to determine if there is any correlation between the number of bike rides and the weather.
